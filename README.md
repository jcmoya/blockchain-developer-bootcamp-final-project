# 1_Idea_Warranty for consume products
Create a Dapp where you can upload a serial number of  a product,  so you are able to justify that you own some product since a specific time.So you are able to demostrate when you buy the product and you are able to use the warranty of that product in case or any problem with that.


function addProduct ( string memory _name, string memory _serialNumber){

}


function checkWarranty(string memory _serialNumber) public  view returns ( string memory) {
    //Checks the the serial number is correct
  
}


function getInitialYear(string memory _serialNumber) public  view returns ( uint) {
    //Checks the Serial number is coorect and the Year where was bought
 
}


function getEndDate(string memory _serialNumber) public  view returns ( uint) {
    
    //Check serial number exist and is valid and the end of the warranty, initially warranty = 2 years
   
 
}
